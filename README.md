## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I started with the structure of the html, keeping in mind how I needed to lay out the elements. I then applied flex to the main and stacked the elements inside. Once they were roughly in the right place, I changed fonts and colours to make sure it replicated the design as closely as possible. Lastly, I added the hover colours and icon overlay and then did the small tweak to make the responsive view match the mobile design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The hardest bit for me was the rollover with the icon. I don't think I have actually hand coded this technique before, so I feel quite pleased I managed to get this to work. I also worked with the transition element for the first time!

I also learned that my time estimates aren't too bad, I timed myself to do this challenge from start to finish. I estimated this would take me around 2 hours and it took me 1h 49m. Not too bad!

### Continued development

Going to try some of the trickier challenges on frontendmentor.io and build on this knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [Udemy Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) - This udemy course is absolutely brilliant. Great for going back to the basics of HTML & CSS and building on my existing development skills. Looking forward to getting to the JS section as I have very little knowledge of JS.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs) - Invaluable as always! Great for referring to when code doesn't quite work the way it should.
